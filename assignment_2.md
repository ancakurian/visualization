# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      CASE STUDY 1: "Iran Protests", visualization created by Federica Fragapane (https://www.behance.net/gallery/154164323/Iran-protests)
      Fragapane's visual representation of a socio-cultural topic is an example of storytelling using graphic representation starting from data. It is the purpose of the graph to advocate for a social cause and to present its numerical data in a convincing way. Periodic updates indicate the amplitude of human lives lost. 
      By choosing the right visualization (therefore amplifying the perceptual qualities of the graph), the representation of each datapoint is a strand of hair. The data updates and the visualization updates in time reflect the progression of the situation it presents to the reader. Presenting the data in an aesthetic way is a strategy in getting the attention of the audience and underlinging the importance of the topic analyzed. Artistry adds to the dramatic social issue being underlined here. The substantive qualities of the visualization stream from the use of real-life data as it has been reported by third-party organizations monitoring the situation on the ground. The visualization covers the progressive data income between October 2022 and August 2023.

      CASE STUDY 2: "Number of World Heritage Sites" (https://100.datavizproject.com/data-type/viz9/)
      The visual presents the number of world heritage sites in three countries. The substantive quality of the viz lies in the use of percentual data in the plot. However, the there is no explanation of how to interpret the two plots. As it presents data from two different years, is it important to know how the values from 2004 compare to those from 2022? Is there anything that explains the difference and how the new sites have become a "heritage" site, given the fact that the sites are not new developments and have most likely been there before the first count in 2004? The two different years when the data was collected suggest a time-line analysis. 
      The chart's aesthetical qualities are a miss. There is no value in the choice of colors. The perceptive qualities also are missing, the vis is not compelling to the reader, but rather neutral. The plot could have represented any data, nothing in the vis implies the fact that the topic is of cultural or historical interest.  






      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      CASE STUDY 1: "Iran Protests", visualization created by Federica Fragapane (https://www.behance.net/gallery/154164323/Iran-protests) 
      By representing the datapoints through the strand of hair, the visual graph is linked to the originating story. However, even though text explanations accompagnie the graph, there is no clear explanation to why the role of hair is central to the story and to the visualization. Anchoring the visualization in the context would have added clarity to the viz. 
      The choice of colors is not supported by the story, nor is it self-explained. The downside of this is the fact that the participation of men in the social protests and in the overall loss of life is not accounted for. 

      CASE STUDY 2: "Number of World Heritage Sites" (https://100.datavizproject.com/data-type/viz9/)
      The visualization is a bar plot, but implies a time progression. A time-line visualization might have represented better the data. As well, a stacked area chart would have presented the data in way that would have underlined a relationship between the data points. 
      The context of the vis and how the data is to be interpreted would have imporved the visualization. It would have anchored it in the domain of expertize it is part of and would have added to the understanding of the field. 
      Annotations explaining how the different values were collected or what made the values differ over time would have added to the clarity of the graph. 




      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
